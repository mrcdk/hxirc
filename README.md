### HXIRC

[![TravisCI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrcdk/hxirc-message-parser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrcdk/hxirc-message-parser)

A IRC message parser written in Haxe.

This is a weekend hack project I made to parse a few raw IRC messages. It hasn't been tested in a production environment and it doesn't follow any particular specification.

#### Usage
Check `src/Main.hx` and `test/TestMessage.hx` for examples.

#### Known issues

- Python target fails.
